     <!-- In HTML there are primarily two kinds of elements (category space) : inline element, block element -->
     <!-- Containers : span, div -->
     <!-- Container tags by default don't have their own styling -->

     <div>Div 1</div>

          <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is <strong>simply</strong> dummy text of the <i>printing</i> and <i>typesetting</i>
          industry. Lorem Ipsum
          has been the
          industry's
          standard
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
          specimen
          book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
          essentially
          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
          passages, and more
          recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
